    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This gelato recipe is from my Italian mother-in-law. This basic recipe may be used as a base for your favorite flavors. Try adding vanilla, shaved chocolate, or your favorite fruits. Experiment with desired flavors!</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Directions
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour the warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
